# Magic 8 Ball of Love

**a product no one asked for. built it anyway. shipping love to prod.**

---

### what is this?

a fully interactive magic 8 ball that only gives one answer: **yes**.

shake the ball. get a telugu meme. get emotionally attacked. say yes. repeat.

### features (because every side project needs a features section)

- a 3D-ish magic 8 ball that jiggles when you hover (eager puppy energy)
- drag-to-shake or click-to-shake (we support lazy romantics too)
- 8 hand-curated telugu memes that cycle without repeats (shuffled like destiny)
- sparkles follow your cursor because we're going full bollywood
- floating hearts in the background (the vibe is *mandatorily romantic*)
- synthesized sound effects — no external files, just pure web audio API wizardry
- a "YES I'LL BE YOUR VALENTINE" button with a heartbeat animation
- confetti explosion on acceptance because duh
- works offline. love doesn't need wifi.

### tech stack

| layer | choice | why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| frontend | vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | no webpack. no vite. no node_modules. just vibes. |
| animations | pure CSS | 60fps romance |
| sound | Web Audio API | synthesized chimes > imported mp3s |
| hosting | github pages | free like my love (jk swapnika is priceless) |
| framework | none | this is a love letter not a SaaS |

### architecture diagram

```
user ---> shakes ball ---> telugu meme ---> emotional damage ---> says yes
                ^                                                    |
                |____________________ not convinced? _______________|
```

### local development

```bash
# clone it
git clone https://github.com/p22chanakya-iima/valentine-magic-8ball.git

# run it (yes that's it. it's one html file.)
open index.html
```

no `npm install`. no `pip install`. no docker. no kubernetes.
just open the file. like opening your heart.

### roadmap

- [x] ship MVP before valentine's day
- [x] make her smile
- [ ] get a "yes" IRL
- [ ] mass production for next valentine's (probably not)

### contributing

this is a 1-person, 1-valentine project. PRs will be rejected with love.

### license

MIT — but if you fork this for your valentine, at least change the names. don't make it weird.
